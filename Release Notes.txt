ðŸ’¬ Commentaries:

In this release, we added a seed system in order to allow the user to populate their database in a fluent way alongside the migrations.
We also improved the endpoints with some cool features, added a set of user-readable exceptions to diferentiate when you want your users to 
read the message or if it is meant only for the logs.

âœ¨ New Features:

    â–¸ Added Seeds to use alongside migrations and populate tables automatically.

    â–¸ Endpoint handlers now can receive the Request object and/or named parameters, besides the flat array it already receives.

    â–¸ You can define multiple HTTP verbs for a given endpoint.

    â–¸ Add a set of user-readable exceptions, so this is the way you tell the framework its message is meant for the end-user to see.

    â–¸ Events now can stop propagation from within listeners, which also interrupts the very event trigger.

    â–¸ Added some very nice helper functions.

    â–¸ Removed that annoying "readonly db user" from the configs. Now the framewok take care of it by itself.

    â–¸ Removed the need for database from the beginning. Now, if the db does not exist, it creates it when applying migrations.

    â–¸ Added support for multitenancy on the migrations and seeds systems. (This one really gave me headaches! xD)

ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes:

    â–¸ A minor fix on Module Loader class.

    â–¸ Fixed a silly bug on automatically built MySQL WHERE clause.

    â–¸ Request was removing the first parameter of the route. (Blaime on the Copilot)
