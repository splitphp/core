ðŸ’¬ Commentaries:

In this release, we added a seed system in order to allow the user to populate their database in a fluent way alongside the migrations.
We also improved the endpoints with some cool features, added a set of user-readable exceptions to diferentiate when you want your users to 
read the message or if it is meant only for the logs.

âœ¨ New Features:

    â–¸ Added Seeds to use alongside migrations and populate tables automatically.

    â–¸ Endpoint handlers now can receive the Request object and/or named parameters, besides the flat array it already receives.

    â–¸ When adding endpoints you can, now, define a name for the endpoint, then retrieve it by its name.

    â–¸ You can define multiple HTTP verbs for a given endpoint.

    â–¸ Add a set of user-readable exceptions, so this is the way you tell the framework its message is meant for the end-user to see.
