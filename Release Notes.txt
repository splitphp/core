ðŸ’¬ Commentaries:

In this release, we improved the migrations system, adding some new options to the CLI, as well support for multitenancy.

---

âœ¨ New Features:

    â–¸ Added Command option: `migrations:status`

    â–¸ Added a `onDatabase` method in the Migration in order to execute operations in any DB from within the same connection.

    â–¸ Enhanced the control over the modules in the context of migrations.

    â–¸ Table Blueprint now has a "label" property to allow the user to define a human-readable representation of the table.

---

ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes:

    â–¸ ModLoader was loading the first module CLI by default, instead of performing the whole discovery.
