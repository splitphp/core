💬 Commentaries:

In this release, we added a seed system in order to allow the user to populate their database in a fluent way alongside the migrations.
We also improved the endpoints with some cool features, added a set of user-readable exceptions to diferentiate when you want your users to 
read the message or if it is meant only for the logs.

✨ New Features:

    ▸ Added Seeds to use alongside migrations and populate tables automatically.

    ▸ Endpoint handlers now can receive the Request object and/or named parameters, besides the flat array it already receives.

    ▸ You can define multiple HTTP verbs for a given endpoint.

    ▸ Add a set of user-readable exceptions, so this is the way you tell the framework its message is meant for the end-user to see.

    ▸ Events now can stop propagation from within listeners, which also interrupts the very event trigger.

    ▸ Added some very nice helper functions.

🔧 Bug Fixes:

    ▸ A minor fix on Module Loader class.
